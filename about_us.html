				 <h1> Australian Design Architects is a team of multi-award winning architects based in Sydney. </h1>

					<p>We specialise in residential and commercial projects of high-quality finishes and details that are sensitive to context and the brief. Our distinctive style is known for its classic proportion and geometric form. </p>

					<p>We enjoy using unexpected materials that challenge and surprise. We also believe that good architecture and respect for the environment go hand in hand.</p>

					<p>Working with your ideas, we can nurture your project from conception to completion. Our innovative and inter-disciplinary skill-set, and extensive network of suppliers, means we can take a project from the first sketch right through to construction. Our team can help you make the right decisions and guide you through the process by bringing our creativity and can-do expertise to the table. Our work-style is collaborative, open and driven by our passion for good design.</p>

					<p>Over the past 20 years our extensive portfolio of residential and commercial projects has been recognised by our peers including the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Institute of Interior Designers and the Australian Design Council.</p>


				 <h2> About Us </h2> 

				 <p>Established in 2001, Australian Design Architects believe contemporary Australian architecture should capture the spirit and culture of our land. We believe homes should provide a refuge from the outside world and that workplaces should have the ability to inspire. </p>

				<p>The buildings we create are sustainable, finely crafted in durable materials and are highly valued by our clients and the community, enabling them to serve with integrity for generations.</p>

				<p>Our role is to understand you, the client, allowing you to realise your vision. We create homes that reflect and celebrate your personalities while nurturing you and your families. We believe contemporary Australian residential design, whether house or apartment, should be sophisticated and relaxed, able to delight the senses. It should respect its climate, sheltering from the sun in summer and from the cold in winter.</p>

				<p>When you first encounter our homes, you will be struck by their impact in the streetscape. Once inside, we respect the importance of creating both a public personality – formal living rooms and studies leading off entrances – and a private sanctuary within. Private spaces are hidden behind sliding walls that can be opened to bring formal and informal spaces together when entertaining.</p>

				<p>We understand that our architecture sits within a landscape that creates a sense of place, so we design urban solutions for urban environments. We embrace the wilderness when building in the country. We also believe that landscape, environment and interiors are absolutely one and must be considered as one.</p>

				<p>This holistic approach means that when you view ADA buildings from afar or walk within their gardens you feel uplifted. When you enter them, you experience a luxurious sense of space and light which is the architecture expressing itself. </p>
